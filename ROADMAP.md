## Vision

PIIK.ME aims to become a complete open-source link intelligence platform that combines URL shortening, bio links, analytics, and developer tooling into a single self-hostable solution.

The long-term goal is to provide an alternative to proprietary platforms while remaining lightweight, privacy-conscious, and easy to deploy.

## Good First Contributions

New to the project? These are great places to start — no deep codebase knowledge required:

- **Documentation improvements** — fix typos, clarify explanations, add missing details
- **UI polish** — improve spacing, alignment, or visual consistency
- **Bug fixes** — pick up a [bug-labeled issue](https://github.com/xthxr/piik.me/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) and submit a fix
- **Test coverage** — add manual or automated test cases for existing features
- **Accessibility improvements** — keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, contrast fixes

Look for issues tagged [`good first issue`](https://github.com/xthxr/piik.me/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) on GitHub. These are ideal for GSSoC and Hacktoberfest contributors.

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

These areas need ongoing attention and are great opportunities for experienced contributors:

- **Test coverage** — no automated test suite exists yet; Jest-based unit and integration tests are in progress
- **Code refactoring** — some route handlers contain business logic that should move into `src/services/`
- **Documentation** — inline code comments are sparse in several modules
- **Performance optimization** — analytics queries could benefit from caching and indexing improvements
- **Accessibility compliance** — the frontend has not been fully audited against WCAG AA standards

If you're tackling any of these, please open an issue first so efforts aren't duplicated.

---

## How to Influence the Roadmap

- **Vote** on existing issues with a 👍 reaction.
- **Open a feature request** on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xthxr/piik.me/issues/new/choose).
- **Start a discussion** in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xthxr/piik.me/discussions).
- **Submit a PR** — shipped code speaks louder than requests.

## Roadmap Disclaimer

This roadmap is intended as a guide rather than a promise. Priorities may change based on community feedback, contributor availability, and project needs.
